in the real world i would create mocks for tests that go out over the network. 

in the interest of time, i did not write tests for some things on the server, like static file serving, or the basic functionality of my little express-like tool. i wasn't sure whether i taken too far the request in the requirements not to use any frameworks. in almost any real-world case, i would use a library for static file serving, middleware, routing, etc.
